# MIDA React Application

MIDA (Medical Imaging Diagnostic Assistant) is a comprehensive medical diagnostic platform designed to assist healthcare professionals in analyzing and diagnosing medical images. The frontend of this platform is built using **React**, providing a dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly interface for managing patients, viewing diagnostic results, and generating reports. The system integrates seamlessly with backend services to retrieve patient data, diagnosis details, and medical reports.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Overview of patient details, diagnostics, and reports.
- **Diagnosis**: Access and analyze diagnostic results, including medical images like CT scans and MRIs.
- **Reports**: Generate, view, and download medical reports for patients.
- **Profile Management**: Update staff profiles and manage user information.
- **Staff Management**: Handle roles, permissions, and management of medical staff.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For creating a dynamic, component-based frontend that efficiently handles state and UI updates.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for an intuitive and responsive user interface.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to the backend and handling data fetches.
- **React Router**: For seamless navigation across various sections of the application.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core programming language for developing the logic and functionality of the app.
